## Failure is Always an Option

- Let people fail without repercussion
- Share that failure without blame
- Come together in a supportive manor
- Call them Post Incident Review rather that Post Mortems

## Blameless is the Key

- Identify the Causes without Identifying People
- Make these Public and Share Results
- Again, Practice!

There are plenty of resources online for performing a Blameless Post Incident Review
