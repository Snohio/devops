## Some of my Guiding Principles or Dogma

<img src='../../img/practice/buddy.png' alt="Buddy Christ" class="wrap align-right" />

### No Handoffs

- **Engineering & Development:** Learn by Doing
- **Documentation:** Run Books, Notes, Engineering designs, Etc.
- **Tasks:** Take control of everything you can!

### Make Work Visible to Everyone

- **Bring in the good stuff from Agile**
  - Stand ups
  - Retrospectives
  - Post Incident Review

### Communication Makes the Team Work

- **Chat Ops:** Don't be afraid to ask in public

  First off, lets start with some of things I learned that formed my DevOps Guiding Principles or Dogma.

  To begin that, I'll start with the No Handoffs. This came from my lessons with the HPSA / BSA team and other items that required "requests" where we waited for other teams to prioritize the work that I needed done before continuing. This is on of the key benefits of Agile / and Agile DevOps. Also in the No Hand Offs category is within the product itself. Having a separate engineering team that is going to work on design and implementation then "hand off" support through documentation and training. Engineers like shiny and new and are always sought for other projects. Including Engineering ON the team keeps everyone in constant communications. It was also important for the engineer(s) to lead operations through the build out / install process.

  Next is to bring in what we learned about Scrum and Agile. The Agile Manifesto created in 2001 was great for streamlining the development process and got us further away from a waterfall model but its rigidity made it difficult to apply to Operations and somewhat to DevOps. However, some of the practices that were created by Scrum and Agile are perfect for DevOps. Those are the practices that make work visible to all such as daily standups, demos and retrospectives, and post incident reviews.
  
  My last principle that I wanted to be sure to include in the new team is communications. This revolved around the notion of ChatOps. Jason Hand's guide to ChatOps opened my eyes to a world where we didn't have to email everything and could have a more valuable stream of communications. Daily Standups also improve those communication channels as well as open community office hours, water cooler chats, lean coffee and happy hours.
