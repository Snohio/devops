  So as I thought about that dogma, putting together a team that could fit the roles and personas that were necessary, it took a bit of time. I was limited in members I could select, comprised mostly of the three teams mentioned earlier. I grabbed the engineer who had been working on the PoC for deploying Chef, my two best US Operations folks that worked with Foglight, one of which had been working deeper on the engineering side, the other with leadership and ITSM skills. I had previously hired two folks from India and one from the Philippines.
  
  Shortly there after added a few developers from India and Philippines that could help with building the tools we needed. Back on the US side, I brought in an intern fresh out of college to be my US developer.
  
  One thing that was vitally important to me was that we have 24 x 7 support and that everyone would participate in the on call rotation. Engineers don't like to be on call, but in my experiences, when your most knowledgeable team members are on call, things will typically be forever fixed. There is a disconnect between less knowledgeable operations staff trying to have things permanently fixed.  
  
  Outside of the US covered from Midnight to Noon Central and US from Noon to Midnight. Our On Call team member was also responsible for changes made during those periods.
  
  From a skills perspective it was important to cover all OSes as we would have to support the client for Redhat Linux, Windows and some AIX and Solaris. We also added folks with development experience with Javascript, Pyton and Ruby.
  
  As the team grew, I was careful to ensure that we stayed balanced.

  I named this team the **DevOps Enablement Services** team so that we were prepared to take on additional tools that provided Services that empowered DevOps to our organization.
