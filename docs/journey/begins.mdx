### About this presentation
This presentation is intended to be a four part series on my DevOps Journey focused around the deployment, usage, and socializtion of Chef.

The first part is focused on my backstory, what worked looked like, that time I discovered the DevOps Community, the building of a team to utilize practices and principles that I had discoverd.
