## Notes For This Slide

### About this presentation

Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms complex infrastructure into code. It is an infrastructure configuration management tool that automates how applications are configured, deployed and managed across networks. In other words, writing cookbooks allows you to manage infrastructure through code, rather than manually configuring multiple servers.

### The Optum Chef Community

The Optum Chef Community is a group of Chef Developers and Teams serving as a Community of Practice lead by the DevOps Enablement Services Team. We advocate for a DevOps style approach so customers can develop, design and write Chef cookbooks to address their own configuration management needs. As you progress on your DevOps and Chef journey we ask that you also become a member of our Chef Community because we can't do this alone in silos.

### Chef Can Be Beneficial to Your Infrastructure Projects

Chef can help teams with configuration management and auto-deployment to infrastructure. By combining automated testing with explicit review and approval gates, Chef reinforces DevOps best practices for delivering applications and infrastructure as code faster and more efficiently than ever with fewer defects and less effort. Chef will also help enforce the desired state for all infrastructure on which your code is deployed. The Chef Community powered by DOES are here to help you along that journey.

### Chef Availability

The Chef Client has been deployed to and running on more than 67,000 virtual and physical servers in Optum. Supported Platforms are listed below, but primarily all *current* Windows and RHEL servers that are in our common Optum environment.
