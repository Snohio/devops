## Where is started

This story starts back in the year 2000. I was hired to support a few dozen servers for an health insurance company that specialized as a Third Party Administrator. I basiclaly took ownership for the data center, including networking, user management, email and database infrastructure.

I have long believed in "A lazy Administrator is a good Administrator" because they automate all of the mundane tasks. That includes builds, user creation, log gathering etc. Little did I know that this mentality is the basis for our current Agile DevOps movements, not to be lazy, but to move fast.

## Flash Forward 10 years

We were purchased by a very large Healthcare Insurance company and it took about another 5 years to "assimilate" our group. During that time we merged with other groups and growing to support 3 data centers with about 150 servers.

I ended up on what was called the "Managed Services" part of the organization. We were were responsible for the OS support for then, about 30 thousand systems, Windows and Linux. With the adoption of virtual servers, that growth continued at a rapid pace.

The Managed Services team was quite large and they were responsible for setting, enforcing, managing all of the OS standards, assisting with new builds, helping application teams with installing their applications, applying security and doing our best to keep the application teams from changing the configurations on the production servers. We were also responsible for monitoring and remediating any issues with those systems.

In 2011, I became the manager of the Off Shift team, those responsible for overnight support and making changes required by the apps teams. I had a team of about 6 on shore and 6 "off shore" team members.

Much of the automation for the builds and tasks were done with HPSA.
