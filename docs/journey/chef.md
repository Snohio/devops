## The Road Less Traveled

Soon after I returned from that trip, we were - like all good fortune 10 organizations - going through another reorg. It was at that time that I had to make a choice of products to support. vRealize or Chef.

I had already engineered with my team the vROps stack and started building out our Chef Infrastructure. But now to choose which I wanted to own and build a team to support. I had convinced my leaders that we needed to break the model of three teams to handle each aspect and we were going to put engineering and development and ops all togeter to support a tool stack.

It was a difficult choice because I knew that vRealize would be more strategic but also knew that vRealize was not going to support my desire to spread the message about DevOps. it was not a DevOps tool. It was monolithic, it required very special expertise in developing Orchestration and Automation tools, and that was going to be a different team entirely. In fact it was the very same BSA team that worked in a vertical and not something I was ever going to control.

I went back and forth a few times, but in the end I had made my decision. I think I surprised my boss when I told him that I wanted to take ownership of Chef.  In hindsight, it was not my best career move, but I still would not have traded it for the world. I wanted to (and still want to) spread the DevOps love. `#hugops`.
