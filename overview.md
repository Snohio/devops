  - *Everything* as Code (in GitHub). Documentation, Notes, Issues, Projects.
  - Kanban / Agile: Iterations, iterations, iterations.
  - ChatOps (alerts, notifications, visibility)
  - Stand-ups, Demos, Celebrations, Retrospectives, Post Incident Reviews

## DevOps Transformation - Where can you start?

- Start Small. Iterations are everything in Agile Delivery and DevOps! Why should the transformation be different.
- Kanban of Some Sort. I'd advocate for GitHub because it is a good common tool that everyone should know the basics of.
- Start Stand-ups and Demos (Retrospectives).
- Take simple issues and practice a Post Incident Review.
  - Create Issues in a Repository
- Developing something!
  - Everything as Code (in GitHub)
    - Start with Issues and Documentation
    - Learn markdown (literally takes 5 minutes)
    - Create Documentation.
      - Just markdown at first then try Docusaurus
  - This all starts the Development Pattern.
- Embrace Infrastructure as Code

## How Chef can help drive DevOps

- Remember, all of this below it iterative
- Start with the Tests!
  - Inspec is a great tool for 
- Long term goal is immutability.
  - Yes, you can have immutability with managed VMs with Chef!
- Special notes!
